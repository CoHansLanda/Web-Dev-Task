### Instructions

1.  Fork this repository to your account
2.  Clone (download) the fork to your computer
3.  Open the project in any text editor
4.  Make the webpage above and commit your code!
5.  Create a Pull Request and send it to `munsoc-mpstme/Web-Dev-Task`
6.  Add us as a reviewer or ping us on the group once you're done!

**NOTE #1:** do NOT email us the code. We will only accept Pull Requests done through GitHub. If you don't know how to use it, learn it! There are plenty of tutorials online.

**NOTE #2:** if you have genuine problems, feel free to reach out to us. But remember - this is a _test_, so don't ask us for direct help!

We will be judging you based on a number of parameters, so try as much as you can - it's okay even if the code isn't completely perfect. All the very best!!
